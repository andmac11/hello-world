# hello-world
I'm new, I don't know what I am doing.
Fellow humans, I just started with free code camp, and I m new to all things coding.  Well, no. Actually, many many years ago I dabbled in some html.  But, I basically taught myself by looking at website code.  It was all pretty basic.  Now I feel old, and completely lost.  I am trying to use my brain to learn something new.
